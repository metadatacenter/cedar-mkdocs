# Extending a Template (adding fields)

We're sorry, this resource has not yet been developed. 
You are welcome to contribute to its development at the link below.

## Introduction


## How to Extend a Template

make a copy

rename appropriately

add a comment (optional)


## Letting Users Add Their Own Fields

simple as using the Attribute-Value field type

doesn't really create a new specification

## Creating an Extended Specification

many specifications are extended for additional uses (sometimes called profiling, alas)

after basic steps, add your desired field, at end or (for example templates) inline

if you want inline but inside an element are used, 
they would have to be extended themselves
