# Creating lists in the metadata entry forms for users

There are several ways to present a list of terms for the user to select from in CEDAR.
Unfortunately, only one of these (described in previous chapters) is truly semantic.
(Eventually we will offer semantic options for all these list types.)

This section serves as a relatively simple review of the types of lists CEDAR
supports. In each list type we'll discuss pros and cons unique to that list type.

In the [Field Type Reference](https://metadatacenter.github.io/cedar-manual/sections/c2/field_type_reference/), you can
find listed the 4 field types
that can generate lists of answers:
Basic Text; Multi-Choice; Checkbox; and Pick From List.

## Basic Text

(Values; Suggestions; Hidden; Default)

## Multi-Choice

(Default; _no Multiple_)

## Checkbox

(Default; _no Multiple_)

## Pick From List

(Single Select vs Multi-Select; Default; _no Multiple_ )

|----------| -----------              |---|
| Basic Text | | |
| Multi-Choice | | Default; _no Multiple_  |
| Checkbox | | Default; _no Multiple_ |
| Pick From List| | Single Select vs Multi-Select; Default; _no Multiple_  |
