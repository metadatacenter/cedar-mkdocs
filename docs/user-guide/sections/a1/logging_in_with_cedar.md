# Logging in with CEDAR

To log in, go to [https://cedar.metadatacenter.org](https://cedar.metadatacenter.org "CEDAR Workbench"), and enter the account name and your password as shown in the screenshot below. If you have forgotten your password, you can use the "Forgot Password?" link just below the Password line. Once you have logged in, you will see the CEDAR Workspace. 

In the next section, we provide important information about the visibility of your account, your content, and your user information. Or if you prefer, you may skip to the CEDAR Workspace [Desktop and Navigation](../../../basic_topics/a4_desktop_and_navigation/) section, or the [Finding Resources](../../../basic_topics/a2_finding_resources/) section.
