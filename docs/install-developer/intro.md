# Introduction

The CEDAR Developer Team uses `macOS Catalina` for development. This guide will describe how to install the CEDAR project and all the dependencies onto an empty macOS. 

Of course, the project could be installed to other operating systems as well, and we encourage you to do so.

In this guide we will install specific versions of the components that provide the underlying infrastructure for CEDAR. It is possible that CEDAR would work with other versions as well, but please try to use the software that we specify here. Otherwise we can not guarrantee that the system will work as expected.
